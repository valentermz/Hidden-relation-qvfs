# Hidden Relation for Quadratic Vector Fields

This repository contains the computations needed to recover the *hidden relation* for quadratic vector fields on the complex plane.

The theoretical background is described in the following paper:

* Yu. Kudryashov and V. Ramirez. *Spectra of quadratic vector fields on C2: The missing relation*. [arXiv:1705.06340v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06340).
