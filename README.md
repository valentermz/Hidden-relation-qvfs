# Hidden Relation for Quadratic Vector Fields

This repository contains the computations needed to recover the *hidden relation* for quadratic vector fields on the complex plane.

The theoretical background is described in the following paper:

* Kudryashov, Yu. and Ramirez, V. *There are no new index theorems for quadratic vector fields on C2*. [arXiv:1705.06340v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06340).
